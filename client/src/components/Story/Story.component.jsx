They arrived in Calgary in 2015 from Italy with big dreams to bring Milan-quality fashion design and manufacturing to Alberta. Tchuigoua spent seven years as a pattern designer with the world-famous brand Dolce & Gabbana, following stints with other big names in Italy over 12 years after the couple moved there from Cameroon.

The couple started small, working out of a room in their Calgary home, taking on all kinds of alterations and custom sewing jobs before deciding to take their dream to the next level. They did so with help from organizations like the Francophone Economic Development Council for Alberta and Futurpreneur Canada, a non-profit that provides financing and mentoring for entrepreneurs.',
