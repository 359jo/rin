        <b> The Refugee Investment Network (RIN)</b> is the first blended
        finance investment collaborative dedicated to creating long-term
        solutions to global forced migration. The RIN moves private capital from
        commitment to active investment by sourcing, structuring, and supporting
        the financing of projects and companies that benefit refugees and host
        communities. Ultimately, the RIN aims to bridge the gap between the
        untapped entrepreneurial potential of refugees and capital markets to
        spur economic growth, create jobs, and increase socio-economic stability
        among displaced people.
