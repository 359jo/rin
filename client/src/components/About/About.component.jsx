              Bridging the gap between the untapped potential of refugees and
              the capital markets.
            </h3>

            <p className="p-theme-1">
              Today, nearly 70 million people have been forcibly displaced
              worldwide – 22 million of whom are refugees – the highest number
              in human history. Modern refugee crises are characterized by
              irregular, forced migration that is compounded by political and
              economic challenges like rising nationalism and slowdowns in job
              creation. Unfortunately, existing systems for short-term emergency
              response and productive integration have not kept up with these
              evolving trends and are both under-resourced and broken.
            </p>
            <p className="p-theme-1">
              The resulting dilemma represents the defining social crisis of our
              time and requires urgent, scalable, and economically sustainable
              solutions.
            </p>
            <p className="p-theme-1">
              While an increasing number of humanitarian efforts strive to
              create and expand economic growth for refugees in host countries,
              private investors and capital are often missing from the equation.
              Significant interest from across the capital continuum exists in
              the social and traditional investment community, but the
              investment landscape in forced migration settings remains highly
              fragmented: Bankable deals are few and far between.
            </p>
            <p className="p-theme-1">
              We see both an enormous need and opportunity to increase deal flow
              by working with groups from all sides – investors, governments,
              donors, host and refugee populations – to improve our
              understanding of how to navigate the investment climate and
              mitigate associated risks to capital and the targeted populations.
              We believe the best way to do this is by building a robust and
              enabled network of impact investors and other stakeholders who,
              working together, can unlock private capital that spurs growth,
              creates jobs, and leads to social and economic prosperity.
